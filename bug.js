```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a flexbox container with two equal-width divs. However, if the content within either div exceeds its allocated width, it might overflow and break the layout.  This can happen unexpectedly because the `w-1/2` class only sets the width to 50% of the *parent* container's width, not the available space within the flex container.
