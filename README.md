# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Overflow Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to flexbox layouts and unexpected overflow. The bug stems from a misunderstanding of how Tailwind's fractional width classes (`w-1/2`, `w-1/3`, etc.) behave within flex containers. While they set the width relative to the *parent* element, they don't inherently prevent content overflow.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The solution, presented in `bugSolution.js`, demonstrates how to fix this by using either `flex-shrink` or `flex-grow` properties to handle content overflow gracefully.
